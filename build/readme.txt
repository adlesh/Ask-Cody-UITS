## Summary ##
AskCody was an existing in-production chatbot for frequently asked questions that
 UITS encounters. However, AskCody did not in its starting state have an existing
 interactive interface (aside from the one provided by its DialogFlow base). We
 were charged with creating a means to interact with the DialogFlow base of the
 project including chatting with it, providing feedback, and fitting into a more
 uniform myCSU experience.

AskCody is only a working title and not the final title of the project.


## How to launch ##
To run the site, simply open | ask-cody-vue.html | in your web browser from your
 source folder.

## Interacting with the bot ##
The bot is being displayed on index.html using a "dummy page" with a simple header,
 but the real player is the question mark in the bottom right. Click the icon to
 open the chat window and start chatting with the bot. Requires an internet connection
 to work.

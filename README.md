# ask-cody-ember

_AskCody_ is an existing in-production chatbot for frequently asked questions that UITS encounters. However, AskCody did not in its starting state have an existing interactive interface (aside from the one provided by its DialogFlow base). We are creating a means to interact with the DialogFlow base of the project including chatting with it, providing feedback, and fitting into a more uniform myCSU experience.
